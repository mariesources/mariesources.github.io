        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
<li><strong>Who can use KN95s?</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Anyone who feels they want or need protection on their face from an airborne sickness can consider these. You can also use them to ensure you aren&rsquo;t touching your face when you are in an environment where you might be exposed. It is entirely up to you.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Are the KN95s the same as N95? Are they NIOSH-approved or FDA-approved?</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>The KN95s are NOT the same as the N95s in the eyes of the FDA. Please refer to the <a href="/ppe.html"><u>section on KN95s</u></a>&nbsp;for more information.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Why are you selling this PPE when US hospitals are using N95s?</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Offering KN95s arose as a need when healthcare professionals noted a lack of proper PPE (N95 masks or other items), and they started to consider KN95s, which are China&rsquo;s standard for medical grade face masks. I helped my own sister, an anesthesiologist, to purchase these masks as a backup, so that she and her colleagues could always have personal masks on hand, just in case.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>What is the feedack from other customers?</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>A video of an unboxing is coming soon.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Do you have any additional pictures of the PPE?</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>All pictures have been provided on the <u><a href="/ppe.html">KN95s mask page</a></u>. If you&rsquo;re looking for more pictures, you can <a href="mailto:marie.sources@gmail.com">email me</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Do you have any feedback from healthcare professionals who have purchased these?</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>So far only that they are thankful to have backups, or to have protection in the absence of N95s.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>I have been fit-tested for N95 and need a size Small. Do you have other sizes?</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>The manufacture only makes this one size for now. The dimension are provided on the <a href="/ppe.html">KN95 mask page</a>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Where do the masks come from?</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>These masks were made in China at a factory licensed to make KN95s.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Does the manufacturer have any manufacturer license or quality certification that we can see?</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Yes, although the business registration documents and performance test results are in Chinese. The CE certification and other such quality check documents are available in English. If you wish to see those, please <a href="mailto:marie.sources@gmail.com">email me</a> .</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>How can I pay for my order?</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>PayPal is the best method for payment at this time. You can still use PayPal to pay with a credit card or bank account. If you are having trouble paying, you can <a href="mailto:marie.sources@gmail.com">email me</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>How much will shipping cost?</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Shipping costs depend on the size of your order (in value, weight, and final packaged dimensions) and the shipping address. Once you submit your order request, I&lsquo;ll get a shipping quote and send you a final invoice for payment. Shipping isn&rsquo;t estimated on the website because it depends on packaging dimensions.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>How soon will I receive my order?</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Once you have paid your order invoice, the shipping agent needs only 1-2 days to process your order and hand it to DHL, UPS, or Fedex for shipment, at which time it begins the shipping process. Once it has been handed over, it can take anywhere from 3-5 days to reach you. Occasionally, it may take an additional 3-4 days, as shipping couriers (such as DHL, UPS, and Fedex) have reduced the number of flights leaving China, as of late March 2020.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>How will I track shipping?</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll be provided a tracking number <em>over email</em> by the shipping agent as soon as the order ships.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Do you anticipate having any problems with these orders entering the US?</strong>
<ul>
<li>There have been occasional delays when certain recipients were asked to provide additional identification or documentation before a shipment could be released by US Customs. To ensure orders will not experience any inspection delays, DHL, UPS, and Fedex have started requiring official customs declaration paperwork for all orders of healthcare-related products leaving China. This should reduce the delays. As of March 2020, no packages have been denied entry or lost.</li>
