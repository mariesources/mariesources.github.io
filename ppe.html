                <p>As of this writing, I’m not helping in the sourcing of N95s. We have been looking into N95 manufacturers in China, some of which do have FDA registration and 3rd party approval, but as this is not my area of expertise, I personally feel it is too risky for everyone involved. So at this time, I won’t be able to assist with any N95 orders. </p>

                <p>On 3/23, I helped my sister, an anesthesiologist, source the KN95 mask, pictured above. She and other healthcare providers have sought out KN95s in the absence or shortage of N95s. These aren’t intended or recommended as a direct N95 replacement when you have access to N95. If you are running low on PPE and are seeking protection, you can consider these.
</p>
                <p>The KN95 is a category of facial masks made in China for a range of professional use. The KN95s offered here have been registered with the FDA as a Class II mask, for medical use. The grade level is GB2626-2006 (you will see this imprinted on the mask packaging), intended for industrial use for dust protection. However, the requirement for particle filtration level is the same as the N95: ≥95% (and it performs so under 3rd party testing). This information is available online for public review. However, they are still not USA FDA approved nor NIOSH-approved. This means that the decision to purchase and use the KN95 is at the buyer’s discretion.
                </p>
                <p>The KN95s available via my agent come in only one size. Dimensions have been indicated in the picture above. At this time I do not have any way to comparire their fit vs. any N95 sizes. No guarantees can be made about fit or seal. 
                </p>
                <p>If you are looking for a way to stave off ear fatigue with the ear loops, and also have the option to adjust tightness, there are behind-the-head loop extenders available in the “Other PPE” tab.

                    <p class="card-text">To make sure you are abreast of the news around KN95 masks: there was a recent account of KN95s ordered from China to the Netherlands and distributed by the gov’t to hospitals; and then recalled when they found then didn’t meet the EU standard. They were testing the KN95 on the same standard as their local FDA approved masks, meaning, they were using it as a direct replacement for N95. I have to stress again that the KN95s are not meant to replace N95 when you have N95 available. As my sister said, it’s better than nothing, when you have nothing. Please take this into account with your decision.</p>
